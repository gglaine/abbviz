This is Gui's vite-redux-ts template (Awesome !) ðŸš€ 

Hey, I'm Guillaume, and this is my test-run with vite-template-redux! This template is a starting point for building React applications using Redux Toolkit and Vite. Designed for performance and developer experience, it comes pre-configured with all the essentials for developing, testing, and deploying scalable web applications.

Features âœ¨
Fast Builds - Utilizes Vite for lightning-fast build and reload times.
State Management - Integrated with Redux Toolkit for state management out of the box.
Styling - Bootstrap included for quick and responsive UI development.
Icons - FontAwesome icons ready to enhance your UI designs.
Data Visualization - Recharts for building interactive charts and graphs.
Testing Setup - Comes with Testing Library for easy testing.
Code Quality - ESLint and Prettier pre-configured for linting and formatting.
TypeScript Support - TypeScript setup for type safety.

Scripts ðŸ› 
npm run dev - Starts the development server.
npm start - An alias for npm run dev.
npm run build - Compiles the app for production deployment.
npm run preview - Previews the build locally.
npm run test - Runs tests using Vitest.
npm run format - Formats code according to Prettier configurations.
npm run lint - Lints code using ESLint rules.
npm run lint:fix - Fixes linting issues automatically.
npm run type-check - Runs TypeScript compiler for type checking.

Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started with this template open your terminal and run these commands:
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
npm installnpm run dev


# vite-template-redux

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

```sh
npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app
```

## Goals

- Easy migration from Create React App or Vite
- As beginner friendly as Create React App
- Optimized performance compared to Create React App
- Customizable without ejecting

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner

## Inspiration

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react)
- [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib)
